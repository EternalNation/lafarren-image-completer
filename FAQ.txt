Q) I get an error like "ScalableDebugging.cpp:46:34: error: no matching function for call to ‘wxImage::SaveFile(std::string&)’"

A) This means you are using wx < 2.9. Please install wx2.9 or greater. You can get the latest version here http://www.wxwidgets.org/

If you build wx in a non-standard directory and don't 'make install' it, you will have to change:

wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE /usr/bin/wx-config
wxWidgets_wxrc_EXECUTABLE /usr/bin/wxrc

to

/home/doriad/bin/wx2.9/wx-config
/home/doriad/bin/wx2.9/utils/wxrc/

Q) When running CMake, I get an error like:
CMake Error at /media/portable/src/Eigen/cmake/FindBLAS.cmake:393 (message):
A required library with BLAS API not found.  Please specify library location.

A) This means you need to install the package blas-devel.

Q) UMFPACK looks very very hard to build from source, and my distribution does not have a umfpack-devel package, what do I do?

UMFPACK is included in the package suitesparse-devel
